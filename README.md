<h1>🚀STAR NAV🚀</h1>
<p>
  ⭐Embark on your next journey using Star-Nav, a navigation system using celestial bodies!⭐
  
🔧 Written in <strong>Python</strong> and using <strong>Django</strong>, this project calculates the ideal star to follow based on your current location and time. 🔧

🖥️ A <strong>React</strong>-powered frontend featuring an embedded Leaflet map for intuitive and seamless navigation. 🖥️
  
  🧭Using real-time star positions and precise mathematical calculations, this application guides you across the night sky, using the stars as your compass to navigate you to your destination.🧭

<p>
  This project uses the Skyfield API for high-precision astronomical computations and Leaflet for interactive map rendering. 
  Skyfield is a Python library that enables accurate calculations of the positions of stars, planets, and other celestial objects, 
  while Leaflet provides lightweight, mobile-friendly maps.
